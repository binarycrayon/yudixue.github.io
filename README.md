I have never ran a half marathon before. I may fail, but I will try my best to train and prepare for the race.

Let me start by sharing a story about why I started running.

Years ago while I was a college student, I had asthma.

Asthma is a respiratory condition marked by spasms in the bronchi of the lungs, causing difficulty in breathing. It is a condition, not a disease, so one could never truly recover from it.

I was young, stupid and was reluctant to seek medical help. Without proper medication, I had trouble walking even a single block on my way to class. I had trouble sleeping as well.

This was especially problematic in the unforgiving winters of the Canadian prairies. By the time I did get the condition under control, it had already cost me more time and money than to finish my education.

Although I cannot recover from the condition, I want to feel stronger by doing cardio. I chose running.

When I started running, I had trouble to running 3k, let along 5k, and 10k seemed impossible. But the more I ran, the more I learned to control my pace and limit so that I can plan to improve. Finally, I was able to take less time and run for longer distances.

This year in Vancouver, I have participated in three 10k races. I am doing another Van East 10k in October, then my first rock n roll half marathon in late October. So this would be my second half marathon.

If my experience is not much of an inspiration to you, I certainly hope to prove my dedication to running, and convince you to donate.

Please help me raise funds for the Heart of Hope breakfast meal program.

Thank you!
